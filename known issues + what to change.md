Known Issues:
- Using animated vertex groups can extremely slow down the script
- certain levels of subdivisions result in the current Blender session being pretty unstable once it's finished. (Save the file and restart Blender to fix it while keeping the result)

To change:
- check if script works faster if multiple mdds are saved for multiple frames, instead of importing one big mdd on one object.
