# retroactive-beautifier

#IMPORTANT: V_01_1.py MIGHT BE BUGGED. If it doesn't work, use V_01_0_0 from https://github.com/Cardboy0/retroactive-beautifier/tree/old-versions instead

For making beauty modifiers that require a basis-shape as reference (e.g. corrective smooth) use a whole animation instead of one shape as their basis.
More details on how to use are in the script itself.

If you use my SACS script, I recommend using the RB on your result.
